**Description:**
Initialize the project repository structure with separate directories for frontend (React), backend (FastAPI), deployment (Helm charts), and documentation. Setup development environment with necessary dependencies and tools.

**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** To Do  
**Assigned To:** Unassigned  
**Dependencies:** None

## Sub-tasks / Checklist:
- [ ] Create root project directory structure (frontend/, backend/, deployment/, docs/)
- [ ] Initialize React application with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Setup FastAPI project structure with virtual environment
- [ ] Install and configure development dependencies (ESLint, Prettier, pytest)
- [ ] Create .gitignore file with appropriate exclusions
- [ ] Setup package.json and requirements.txt files
- [ ] Initialize Git repository and create initial commit
- [ ] Create basic docker-compose.yml for local development
- [ ] Setup environment configuration files (.env templates)
- [ ] Create basic CI/CD workflow structure

## PRD Reference:
* Section: "Frontend Stack" and "Backend Stack"
* Key Requirements:
    * React + Tailwind CSS + Axios for frontend
    * Python (FastAPI) or Node.js for backend
    * All components containerized using Docker
    * Deploy on OCI OKE using Helm charts

## Notes:
This is the foundation task that enables all subsequent development. Consider using modern development tools and practices including TypeScript for better code quality and Docker for consistent development environments.
