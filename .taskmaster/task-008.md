# Task-008: Setup GenAI Integration Service

**Description:**
Create a centralized GenAI service that handles integration with OpenAI or OCI GenAI APIs, prompt engineering, response generation, caching, and batching for performance optimization across all modules.

**Priority:** High  
**Status:** To Do  
**Assigned To:** Unassigned  
**Dependencies:** Setup Backend Infrastructure and API Gateway

## PRD Reference:
* Section: "Backend Stack", "Alerts & Insights Page", "Remediation Panel", "Conversational Agent"
* Key Requirements:
    * OpenAI or OCI GenAI APIs integration
    * Pass issue data, get remediation suggestions
    * Natural language explanation of issues
    * Recommendations from GenAI model
    * Chat powered by GenAI with context from OCI APIs
    * Centralized GenAI service for all modules

## Notes:
Design the service to be model-agnostic, allowing easy switching between different AI providers. Implement robust caching to reduce API costs and improve response times.
