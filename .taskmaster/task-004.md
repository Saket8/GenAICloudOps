# Task-004: Implement OCI SDK Integration Service

**Description:**
Develop the core service for integrating with OCI SDK to fetch resource information, metrics, and manage OCI services. This includes connection setup, authentication, and basic resource discovery.

**Priority:** High  
**Status:** To Do  
**Assigned To:** Unassigned  
**Dependencies:** Setup Backend Infrastructure and API Gateway

---

## Sub-tasks / Checklist:
- [ ] Setup OCI SDK and authentication configuration
- [ ] Implement OCI connection and session management
- [ ] Create service discovery for OCI compartments
- [ ] Develop VM and compute instance data fetching
- [ ] Implement database service information retrieval
- [ ] Add OKE cluster discovery and connection
- [ ] Create API Gateway and Load Balancer integration
- [ ] Implement resource metrics collection (CPU, Memory, Network)
- [ ] Add health status monitoring for resources
- [ ] Create compartment filtering functionality
- [ ] Implement error handling and retry logic for OCI calls
- [ ] Add caching mechanism for frequently accessed data

## PRD Reference:
* Section: "Backend Stack" and "Dashboard Page"
* Key Requirements:
    * OCI SDK for pulling resource info and metrics
    * List of OCI services in selected compartment (VMs, Databases, OKE clusters, API Gateway, Load Balancer)
    * Real-time metrics (CPU, Memory, Network, Health status)
    * Toggle for compartment/project filter

## Notes:
Ensure proper OCI authentication setup using configuration files or environment variables. Implement efficient caching to reduce API calls and improve performance.
