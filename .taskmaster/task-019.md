# Task-019: Implement Cost Analyzer Backend

**Description:**
Develop backend services to fetch OCI cost reports and usage data, identify top costly resources, analyze cost trends, and integrate with GenAI for cost optimization recommendations and anomaly detection.

**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** To Do  
**Assigned To:** Unassigned  
**Dependencies:** Setup GenAI Integration Service, Implement OCI SDK Integration Service

## Sub-tasks / Checklist:
- [ ] Setup OCI cost reporting API integration
- [ ] Implement usage data collection and processing
- [ ] Create top costly resources identification logic
- [ ] Develop cost trend analysis algorithms
- [ ] Implement GenAI integration for optimization suggestions
- [ ] Add cost anomaly detection functionality
- [ ] Create cost forecasting capabilities
- [ ] Implement compartment-based cost breakdown
- [ ] Add resource utilization analysis

## PRD Reference:
* Section: "Cost Analyzer & Optimization Module"
* Key Requirements:
    * Endpoints: /cost/top, /cost/analyze
    * Use OCI SDK to fetch cost reports and usage data
    * Identify top 3 costly resources by compartment or tenancy
    * Send cost data to GenAI for optimization suggestions
    * Analyze cost trends and detect anomalies

## Notes:
Ensure accurate cost calculation and consider implementing cost allocation strategies. Focus on actionable optimization recommendations that can provide measurable savings.
