# 🤖 Chatbot Testing Guide - Tasks 12 & 13 Complete!

## ✅ Implementation Status

Both **Task 12 (Backend)** and **Task 13 (Frontend)** have been successfully implemented! Here's how to test the full chatbot functionality:

## 🔧 Prerequisites

1. **Backend Server Running**: The backend should be running on `http://localhost:8000`
2. **Frontend Server Running**: The frontend should be running on `http://localhost:5173`

## 🚀 Testing Steps

### Step 1: Access the Application

1. Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:5173`
2. You should see the GenAI CloudOps dashboard

### Step 2: Login

**Use these credentials:**
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `AdminPass123!`

### Step 3: Open the Chatbot

1. Look for the chatbot icon (robot icon) in the top right or navigation area
2. Click to open the chatbot panel
3. The chatbot should slide in from the right side

### Step 4: Test Basic Chat

Try these messages to test different features:

#### Test 1: Basic Greeting
```
Hello! Can you help me?
```
**Expected**: Welcome message with system information

#### Test 2: Infrastructure Query
```
Why is my instance not responding?
```
**Expected**: Intent detection (TROUBLESHOOTING), helpful troubleshooting guidance

#### Test 3: Cost Query  
```
What are my current monthly costs?
```
**Expected**: Intent detection (COST_OPTIMIZATION), cost analysis guidance

#### Test 4: Template Suggestion
```
Show me compute instances
```
**Expected**: Infrastructure query response with template suggestions

### Step 5: Test Advanced Features

#### Template Usage
1. Click the magic wand icon (🪄) in the chatbot header
2. Browse available templates
3. Select a template and fill in variables
4. Test the generated query

#### Conversation History
1. Click the history icon (📋) in the chatbot header  
2. View past conversations
3. Test loading a previous conversation

#### Export Functionality
1. Click the download icon (⬇️) in the chatbot header
2. Export the conversation in different formats

#### Analytics Dashboard
1. Click the analytics icon (📊) in the chatbot header
2. View conversation statistics and insights

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### ✅ What Should Work

1. **Authentication**: Login with admin credentials
2. **Chat Interface**: Responsive chat UI with typing indicators
3. **Intent Recognition**: Automatic detection of user intents
4. **Smart Responses**: Context-aware responses (currently in offline mode)
5. **Template System**: 22+ predefined query templates
6. **Conversation Management**: Session persistence and history
7. **Export Features**: Multiple export formats
8. **Analytics**: Usage statistics and insights
9. **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### 🔄 Offline Mode Features

Since the external AI service may not be available, the chatbot runs in **intelligent offline mode**:

- **Smart Fallback Responses**: Context-aware responses based on message content
- **Intent Recognition**: Pattern-based intent detection still works
- **Template Suggestions**: Query templates still suggested based on intent
- **Full Database Integration**: All conversations, intents, and analytics stored
- **Complete UI Features**: All frontend features fully functional

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Chatbot Won't Open
1. Ensure you're logged in with the admin credentials
2. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
3. Verify both backend (port 8000) and frontend (port 5173) are running

### If Chat Messages Fail
1. **Expected in Offline Mode**: You should see helpful fallback responses
2. The responses will indicate "offline mode" - this is normal
3. Intent detection should still work (showing badges like "TROUBLESHOOTING")

### If Login Fails
1. Ensure backend is running: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health` should return 200
2. Try the exact credentials: `admin` / `AdminPass123!`
3. Check browser network tab for authentication errors

## 🌟 Key Features to Test

### 1. Intent Recognition
- Try messages with different intents and see the colored badges
- **Infrastructure**: "show me instances"
- **Troubleshooting**: "why is it not working"  
- **Cost**: "how much am I spending"
- **Monitoring**: "what alerts are active"

### 2. Template System
- Open template selector and browse categories
- Test variable substitution in templates
- Check template usage statistics

### 3. Conversation Features
- Send multiple messages to build conversation history
- Test conversation export in different formats
- Check conversation analytics

### 4. Accessibility
- Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Esc)
- Use keyboard shortcuts:
  - `Ctrl+/`: Focus input
  - `Ctrl+T`: Open templates  
  - `Ctrl+H`: Open history
  - `Esc`: Close modals

### 5. Responsive Design
- Test on different screen sizes
