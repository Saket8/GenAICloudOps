## PRD Reference:
* Section: "Alerts & Insights Page" and "Backend Stack"
* Key Requirements:
    * Summary of alerts from OCI Monitoring
    * OCI Logging API and Monitoring API integration
    * Natural language explanation of issues
    * Real-time monitoring data processing

## Notes:
Focus on efficient alert processing and ensure the system can handle high volumes of monitoring data. Consider implementing alert deduplication to avoid notification spam. 

## Completion Notes:
**✅ COMPLETED** - January 30, 2025

### What was accomplished:

#### OCI Monitoring Integration
- **Monitoring Service**: Created comprehensive `MonitoringService` with OCI Monitoring & Logging API integration
- **Alert Processing**: Implemented alert classification, prioritization, and health scoring algorithms
- **API Clients**: Added OCI Logging Management and Log Search clients to existing OCI service
- **Caching Layer**: Integrated Redis caching with 5-minute TTL for performance optimization

#### API Endpoints Created
- **Alert Summary**: `/monitoring/alerts/summary` - Comprehensive alert overview with health scores
- **Alarm Management**: `/monitoring/alarms` & `/monitoring/alarms/history` - Current alarms and history
- **Metrics Data**: `/monitoring/metrics` - Time-series metrics retrieval with namespace support
- **Log Search**: `/monitoring/logs/search` - OCI Log Search API integration
- **Health Monitoring**: `/monitoring/health` & `/monitoring/dashboard` - System health and dashboard data
- **Testing**: `/monitoring/test` - Integration testing endpoint

#### Key Features Implemented
- **Smart Fallback**: Graceful degradation to mock data when OCI unavailable (perfect for development)
- **Health Scoring**: Intelligent health calculation based on alert severity and frequency
- **Alert Classification**: Support for Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info severity levels
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper OCI exception management
- **RBAC Integration**: Permission-based access control for all monitoring endpoints
- **Configuration**: Added monitoring-specific configuration settings to core config

#### Technical Implementation
- **Real OCI Integration**: Successfully connecting to OCI Monitoring and Logging APIs
- **Performance Optimized**: Redis caching, async operations, and efficient data aggregation
- **Production Ready**: Proper error handling, logging, and monitoring capabilities
- **Extensible Design**: Modular service design allows easy addition of new monitoring features
