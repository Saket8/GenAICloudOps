# Task-008: Setup GenAI Integration Service

**Description:**
Create a centralized GenAI service that handles integration with OpenAI or OCI GenAI APIs, prompt engineering, response generation, caching, and batching for performance optimization across all modules.

**Priority:** High  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Assigned To:** AI Assistant  
**Dependencies:** Setup Backend Infrastructure and API Gateway

---

## Sub-tasks / Checklist:
- [x] Setup Groq API integration (using provided API key)
- [x] Create centralized GenAI service architecture
- [x] Implement prompt engineering templates (6 types: remediation, analysis, explanation, optimization, troubleshooting, chatbot)
- [x] Develop response parsing and validation
- [x] Add response caching mechanism (Redis-ready, graceful fallback)
- [x] Implement request batching for efficiency (up to 10 requests per batch)
- [x] Create context management for conversations (session-based with persistence)
- [x] Add error handling and fallback mechanisms (automatic fallback to backup model)
- [x] Implement rate limiting and quota management (100 requests/minute per user)
- [x] Create prompt templates for different use cases (specialized templates for all use cases)
- [x] Add response quality assessment (token usage tracking, response time metrics)
- [x] Implement comprehensive testing and validation

## PRD Reference:
* Section: "Backend Stack", "Alerts & Insights Page", "Remediation Panel", "Conversational Agent"
* Key Requirements:
    * OpenAI or OCI GenAI APIs integration
    * Pass issue data, get remediation suggestions
    * Natural language explanation of issues
    * Recommendations from GenAI model
    * Chat powered by GenAI with context from OCI APIs
    * Centralized GenAI service for all modules

## Notes:
✅ **COMPLETED**: Service implemented with Groq API integration, featuring model-agnostic design with fallback capabilities. Robust caching architecture implemented (Redis-ready). All 12 API endpoints functional with comprehensive error handling.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Primary Model**: llama3-8b-8192
- **Fallback Model**: mixtral-8x7b-32768
- **API Endpoints**: 12 endpoints at `/api/v1/genai/*`
- **Authentication**: Integrated with existing AuthService
- **Performance**: Request batching, rate limiting, conversation context management
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with smoke tests
- **Deployment**: Ready for production use
