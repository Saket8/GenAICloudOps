## PRD Reference:
* Section: "Backend Stack" and "Dashboard Page"
* Key Requirements:
    * Real-time metrics (CPU, Memory, Network, Health status)
    * Use WebSocket or polling to show action status
    * Live data updates across all modules
    * Real-time alert notifications

## Notes:
Balance between real-time updates and system performance. Consider implementing intelligent polling intervals based on data criticality and user activity.
