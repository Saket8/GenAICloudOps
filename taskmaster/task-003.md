## PRD Reference:
* Section: "Backend Stack"
* Key Requirements:
    * Python (FastAPI) or Node.js
    * Modular microservices for each functional domain
    * Unified API gateway to route requests to appropriate services
    * Integration with OCI SDK, Kubernetes client, and GenAI APIs

## Notes:
Design the backend with scalability in mind, allowing for easy addition of new modules and services. Consider using async/await patterns for better performance with external API calls.
