- [ ] Create RBAC roles and bindings retrieval
- [ ] Implement pod status and metrics fetching
- [ ] Add pod logs extraction functionality
- [ ] Create namespace discovery and filtering
- [ ] Implement resource watch and monitoring
- [ ] Add error handling for cluster connectivity issues

## PRD Reference:
* Section: "Unified Access Analyzer Module (RBAC + IAM)" and "Pod Health & Log Analyzer (OKE)"
* Key Requirements:
    * Use Kubernetes Python client to fetch RBAC roles and bindings
    * Use Kubernetes Python client to fetch pod status and logs
    * Support for OKE cluster integration
    * Monitor deployed application pod status

## Notes:
Ensure proper cluster authentication and consider implementing connection pooling for multiple OKE clusters. Design the service to be reusable across different modules.
