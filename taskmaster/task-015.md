# Task-015: Develop Unified Access Analyzer Backend

**Description:**
Create backend services for the Access Analyzer module that fetches Kubernetes RBAC and OCI IAM policies, performs risk scoring, and integrates with GenAI for security recommendations and policy analysis.

**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** To Do  
**Assigned To:** Unassigned  
**Dependencies:** Implement Kubernetes Client Integration, Setup GenAI Integration Service, Implement OCI SDK Integration Service

- [ ] Develop risk scoring algorithm for access policies
- [ ] Create policy data structuring and normalization
- [ ] Implement GenAI integration for policy analysis
- [ ] Add security recommendation generation
- [ ] Create policy comparison and diff functionality
- [ ] Implement access path analysis
- [ ] Add compliance checking against best practices
- [ ] Create policy remediation suggestions
- [ ] Implement policy export and reporting
- [ ] Add historical policy change tracking

## PRD Reference:
* Section: "Unified Access Analyzer Module (RBAC + IAM)"
* Key Requirements:
    * Endpoints: /access/rbac, /access/iam, /access/analyze
    * Use Kubernetes Python client to fetch RBAC roles and bindings
    * Use OCI Python SDK to fetch IAM policies
    * Parse and structure RBAC and IAM data
    * Risk scoring function for both RBAC and IAM (high, medium, low)
    * GenAI integration for security insights and recommendations

## Notes:
Focus on accurate risk assessment and ensure the system can handle complex policy hierarchies. Consider implementing policy simulation capabilities for testing changes.
