# Task-017: Implement Pod Health & Log Analyzer Backend

**Description:**
Develop backend services to monitor OKE pod status, detect issues (CrashLoopBackOff, Pending, Error states), extract and analyze logs, and integrate with GenAI for root cause analysis and remediation suggestions.

**Priority:** Medium

## Sub-tasks / Checklist:
- [ ] Create pod status monitoring service
- [ ] Implement pod state detection (CrashLoopBackOff, Pending, Error)
- [ ] Develop log extraction and parsing functionality
- [ ] Add error pattern recognition in logs
- [ ] Implement GenAI integration for log analysis
- [ ] Create root cause analysis algorithms
- [ ] Add remediation suggestion generation
- [ ] Implement pod restart count tracking
- [ ] Create pod performance metrics collection
- [ ] Add namespace-based filtering
- [ ] Implement log aggregation and indexing
- [ ] Create automated issue detection and alerting

## PRD Reference:
* Section: "Pod Health & Log Analyzer (OKE)"
* Key Requirements:
    * Endpoints: /oke/pods/status, /oke/pods/logs, /oke/pods/analyze
    * Use Kubernetes Python client to fetch pod status and logs
    * Detect pods in CrashLoopBackOff, Pending, or Error state
    * Extract recent logs and identify error patterns
    * Send logs and status to GenAI for summarization and root cause analysis

## Notes:
Focus on efficient log processing and pattern recognition. Consider implementing log retention policies and ensure the system can handle high-volume log data from multiple pods.
